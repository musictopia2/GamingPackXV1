1.  The Private Piles Only Creates One.
So there seems to be no issues with privatepiles disposing.


solved some issues with the multiple piles.

however, whatever i did was not good enough though.

because just selecting something disposes them (bad).


looks like for the multiple piles, it only happens if using the frame.
