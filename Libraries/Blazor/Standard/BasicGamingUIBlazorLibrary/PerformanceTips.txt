This is what to improve for next time.

I saw from the solitaire ones, that if they are drawn and later is invisible, its not disposed.
that is encouraging.

means i have another option.
another possible option can be to in some cases use a special control and set visible to false for cases where its not visible.
that would be a special div.

i can put that into a control.


another tip:

use the idea from the multiple piles.
but go a little further.

because this time, if its a list, each item will use the special control.

this control not only handles visible/invisible.
but also handles the key diffs (a custom way)

which would be a general control but a card one would use it.
